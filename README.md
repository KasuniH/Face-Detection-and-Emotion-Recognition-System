 Batch Face Detection and Emotion Recognition System is a Python-based project designed to process a collection of images, detect faces within those images, and recognize the emotions displayed by these faces. Utilizing powerful libraries such as OpenCV for face detection and the fer library for emotion recognition, this system automates the analysis of static image files without requiring real-time hardware like a webcam. Users can input a folder of images, and the system will output annotated images indicating detected faces and their corresponding emotions, along with summary statistics. This project provides a practical application of computer vision and machine learning techniques, making it an excellent choice for learning and exploration in these fields.# Face-Detection-and-Emotion-Recognition-System
